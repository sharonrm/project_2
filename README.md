Recommendation App 

As a busy parent I rarely have the time to watch tv let alone figure out what shows I might like to watch. This application 
will allow anyone to enter a tv show they know they like and get back a suggestion for other shows they might like.

API  link - https://tastedive.com/read/api

NPM package - JS Hint - https://github.com/jshint/jshint

Challenges - I think figuring out the API will br tricky as well as the general routing of the data and setting up login.

Technology I anticipate using: Jquery, HTML, CSS, NODE.js, express, mustache, Javascript, pg promise, bodyparser, axios and ajax.

Unsolved problems - still unsure how to get API to work and still unclear on how to incorporate 2 models.

Installations Instructions - to follow.
