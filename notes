Questions

	first search with the original movie 
	title to locate imdb title.

	Then use imdb title to find similiar movies.
	Store this information in users favorites.

API - Can I use a poster path .jpg file to image?
Will need a forEach to go through all the data.

title = response.data.results["0"].title
summary = response.data.results["0"].overview
poster = response.data..results["0"].poster_path
releaseDate = response.data.results["0"].release_date
voterRating = response.data.results["0"].vote_average
movie_id = response.data.results["0"].id
